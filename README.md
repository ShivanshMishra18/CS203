Lab 2:<br>
  Tasks:<br>
    Write functions to perform the following operations on a linked list:<br>
    1. Add an element to the front.<br>
    2. Delete the first element.<br>
    3. Delete the element with given (x,y).<br>
    4. Search and print elements within a Euclidean distance d.<br>
    5. Search and tell whether element with given (x,y) is present.<br>
    6. Find length of the given linked list.<br>
